# Tictactoe-Practice

This is NOT my code. This is practice on learning how to write a tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript using the Minimax algorithm from FreeCodeCamp.
I am practicing my JavaScript skills and this tutorial was very helpful in helping me think logically and how to apply functions and variables to the game.

The instructor is Beau Carnes.
